<h1>Project Progress</h1>
<p>1. We are using the Star Wars API ( swapi.co )</p>
<p>2. We have a sketch drawn out on a piece of paper. But our app will allow the user to look at all 7 of the Star Wars films on the API
and see data about each film. This data will include the film title, release date, director, producers, characters, and more.</p>
<p>3. One of the things I am not sure how to accomplish would be to make the data clean and organized. We can get the data on there
  but then applying the CSS to the data gives us weird results. Also, off the top of our heads, we do not know how to make the button
  an image instead of the text.</p>
